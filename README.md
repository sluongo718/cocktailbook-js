flatiron javascript project 

hello welcome to my first js project

the project is a basic cocktailbook
inspired by my passed job of being a server/bartender 
bartenders hate it when a guest comes in asking for a drink that nobody knows how to make
or when the want it a special way 
so i thought to make for a quick tool to keep track of all the drinks you dont know for next time. 
after all when you ask a bartender to make a drink they dont know theyll say one sec walk to the back and look it up in there phone
so lets make that easier!!!

the coding languages used for this project are javascript, html, css, ruby on rails(rails api)

to start the program

clone this repository and the backend repository https://github.com/sluongo718/js-project

in the backend repo start the server with rails s, you might need to run rails db:migrate first, then open the js frontend up
one thats done start saving your cocktails!!!
